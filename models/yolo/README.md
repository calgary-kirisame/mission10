# models/yolo — PFM-1 detection model pipeline

Single-class YOLOv11 detector for surface-laid PFM-1 replica mines, trained on
synthetic imagery and deployed to the Hailo-8 on each drone's CM5. This folder
owns everything from scene generation to exported weights; the *consumer* of
the resulting `.hef` lives in the ROS detection package.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `datagen/` | Synthetic dataset generator. Pure-python pipeline (placement, flight stations, YOLO labels) + a Blender adapter that only renders. |
| `test/` | Unit tests for the pure pipeline. `cd models/yolo && python3 -m unittest discover -s test -t .` (CI runs this). |
| `assets.lock` | Pinned checksums + provenance for the Blender scene archive. The payload itself never enters git. |
| `assets/` | (gitignored) Extracted scene assets — `Grass.blend`, `pfm1-mine-grass.blend`, textures. Fetch per `assets.lock`. |
| `dataset/` | (future) Rendered images + labels, assembled for training. Never committed. |
| `train/` | (future) Training configs/scripts (Ultralytics, runs on RunPod). |
| `export/` | (future) Hailo Dataflow Compiler export → `.hef`, plus `weights.lock`. The DFC wheel is proprietary: bring-your-own-binary, never committed. |

## Usage

Label-only dump (no Blender needed — fast, for inspecting geometry/labels):

```sh
cd models/yolo
python3 -m datagen.dump --out /tmp/dump --scenes 0:5
```

Rendering (Blender adapter; see the bench list in `datagen/generate.py`
before trusting output):

```sh
blender -b assets/Grass.blend -P datagen/generate.py -- --out dataset/raw --scenes 0:50
```

Determinism: everything derives from `random.Random(f"{seed}:{scene_index}")`.
Same config + same scene index = byte-identical labels, render-identical
scenes. Label-only runs and render runs share `write_scene`, so labels can
never drift from renders.

## Geometry contract

Labels are computed by **projection through the same camera model the runtime
uses** (`mission_engine.core` — `CameraModel`, `project_raw`, serpentine
flight paths), never from Blender state and never from flat-ground trig.
Training geometry == runtime geometry, including camera tilt. Consequences:

- A camera config change (tilt, FOV, resolution) is a one-line `CameraModel`
  edit + dataset regen. **Open decision:** downward camera may move from 10°
  forward tilt to true nadir (0°) now that a forward obstacle camera is
  planned — decide *before* the first real training run; the physical mount
  must match the configured number.
- If rendered images and labels visibly disagree, the bug is in the adapter's
  coordinate transforms, not in silent label corruption.

## Prior art & design consequences

The directly relevant thread is Binghamton University's PFM-1/UAV work
(Nikulin, De Smet, Baur, et al.). Start with:

**Karwandyar, Pingel & Nikulin, "Deep Learning and Multiview-Based Detection
of Scatterable PFM-1 Landmines," Geomatics 6(3):54, 2026.**
YOLOv11x on real RGB imagery of an inert PFM-1 + 3D-printed replicas,
9–13 m AGL. What it changes for us:

1. **Out-of-sample collapse is the central risk.** Their test recall
   (85–93%) fell to **14–24%** on imagery from a different day/site/lighting
   — and that was a real→real gap. Our synthetic→real gap should be assumed
   worse until measured. *Consequence: build a real-imagery OOS test set
   before celebrating any training metrics.*
2. **Printable replicas are public.** Their PLA replica files (validated
   against a 3D scan of an inert mine, HALO Trust dimensions):
   <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7040404>. *Consequence: print + paint a
   batch — they are the OOS test props and field-test targets.*
3. **Shortcut features cut both ways.** Their training mine carried a carved
   Cyrillic marking; the model partially keyed on it — a bug for real-world
   demining. For us it *inverts*: the IARC props carry designed-in signatures
   (see below), and the failure mode is our synthetic mine **lacking or
   mis-rendering** features every real prop has.
4. **Match the prop, not the real mine.** Binghamton's material findings
   (metal central cylinder, white band, semi-gloss paint) describe *real*
   PFM-1s. The IARC competition props are different (see below); our Blender
   mine must model the prop.
5. **Background diversity drove OOS robustness** (their COCO-mixing variant).
   *Consequence: domain-randomize beyond one grass scene; keep negative
   (mine-free) frames in the dataset.*
6. **Per-frame detection beats orthomosaics** (SfM ghosting destroys small
   targets) — validates the onboard real-time per-frame architecture.
7. **RGB beats thermal operationally** — their own 2018 thermal protocol only
   worked in narrow early-morning diurnal windows.
8. **Geolocation benchmark:** yaw+AGL+FOV projection (no SfM) achieved
   **1.75 m mean error at 10 m AGL**. Our full-attitude backprojection at
   4–8 m plus clustering must beat this comfortably.

Caveats: tiny OOS set (11–15 positives), internal metric inconsistencies,
one campus, leaf-off winter, hand-placed (no scatter-pose statistics),
dataset not released.

### The IARC prop is its own target class

Per the Mission 10 resource addendum, the competition mines are **3D-printed
PFM-1 replicas**: matte (no gloss-matching needed), **no metal cylinder**,
**"IARC" engraved** where real mines carry Cyrillic markings, and a
**1-inch AprilTag** affixed. Per "MISSION 10 ACTION," detection technology is
deliberately de-emphasized: the body exists for shape detection, the tag to
simplify identification. Consequences:

- **Blender mine must match the prop**: matte PLA-like material, IARC
  engraving, AprilTag texture. Modeling the *real* mine's materials would be
  training on the wrong target.
- **Tag spec (official, `AprilTag_Identifiers.pdf`): `tag36h11`, mine IDs
  0 or 12 — and other field objects may carry *other* tag36h11 IDs.** Render
  mines with IDs 0/12; eventually render tagged non-mine objects
  (landmarks/"other items") with other IDs as negatives.
- **At survey altitude the tag is a *tagged-object* cue, not a mine cue.**
  At 25.4 mm it spans ~4–9 px at 4–8 m AGL — a high-contrast blob, but
  decoys wear identical-looking blobs, so **shape must carry
  classification**. Render the tag faithfully (the blob is real signal the
  detector will see) but don't expect it to discriminate.
- **The tag is a dip-altitude confirmer + localizer.** Decode floor
  bracketed at ~0.9–1.75 m AGL (organizers' 10 px/module vs typical-library
  5 px/module; bench rig measures the truth). A decode yields identity plus
  tag pose — three-way verdict (ID 0/12 = mine; other ID = confirmed
  non-mine, i.e. a tagged "other item", not necessarily mine-shaped; no
  decode = shape-only fallback) and mine position to centimeters, far inside
  the 1.75 m prior-art benchmark. Verdicts require **tag-on-candidate
  association** (a tagged landmark beside a real mine must not veto it).
  Cascade: YOLO proposes, AprilTag adjudicates.
- **Open question (addendum):** tag on one face or both? Scattered mines lie
  either side up; the tag-down fraction bounds how often dips can confirm by
  decode vs falling back to shape only. Also unconfirmed: whether the
  engraving is recessed or printed (affects rendering).

### Generic small-object UAV-YOLO literature

Surveyed four 2025–2026 *Scientific Reports* "improved YOLO + VisDrone"
papers. Quality ranged from mediocre to fabricated; none touch mines, grass,
or synthetic training. The single robust, convergent, Hailo-compilable
takeaway: **a stride-4 P2 detection head dominates small-object gains**
(+2.4–3.2 mAP50 standalone in every honest ablation; `yolo11-p2.yaml` in
Ultralytics), while bolt-on attention modules contribute marginally and often
don't compile. Relevant because PFM-1 at 8 m AGL letterboxed to a 640 input
is ~8 px: pick input resolution / altitude band / P2 head as one combined
budget decision, and measure the px-size vs recall curve on synthetic data
before spending flight time.
